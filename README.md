## About Me

I'm Alfonso Caio Espino, a 13-year-old 7th grader learning to code. I have learned basic front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am certified in web design by [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). I am eager to learn back-end web development, Python, machine learning, 2D animation, and more. Besides coding, I also play trumpet, I'm a modern yoyoer, and a speedcuber.
