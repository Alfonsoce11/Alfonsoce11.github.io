## About Me

I'm Alfonso Espino. I'm 13 and in 7th grade. I like coding and engineering. I know the basics of front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and earned the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/Alfonsoce11/responsive-web-design) from [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). I also know some Python. I want to improve my skills and learn full-stack web development. I also know CAD using [OnShape](https://onshape.com).
